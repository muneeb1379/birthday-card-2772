                <p> Meri pyaari Guriya, happy birthday. May Allah grant you a long life filled with many happinesses. May Allah bless your life with abundance and prosperity....
                   meri pyaari guriya…
                   On this day you were born. This day may be special for everyone, but for me it is the most special of all. Your mom and dad are very lucky to have given birth to you, and I am even luckier that Allah brought you into my life.
                    This day is very special for me, and In sha Allah it will always remain special.</p>

                <h2>LUCKY</h2>
                <p>meri pyaari guriya after you came into my life, I have completely changed…
                    Now I actually enjoy loving someone. I think love is so beautiful… and love becomes even more beautiful when your partner is loyal and caring. Then love becomes even more amazing.
                    My love I only like loving you…
                    Since the time you came into my life I have stopped thinking about other girls.
                    My love you came into my life by your own choice, and now you cannot go back… You came by your choice, but now it won’t be your choice, it will be mine.....and since I have come into your life, I also cannot leave.
                    Yes, I admit that I do wrong sometimes… after small fights I say we should end everything but love I swear I can’t do anything like that. I can’t end anything, I don’t have the courage to leave you… I can never leave you.
                    I will give you my complete support, my love......I promise…
                    I can do anything for you. Even if my parents throw me out of the house it doesn’t matter. I can do anything for you… I can fight the whole world to have you.
                    My love, you also promise that you will never step back…
                    Stay with me no matter what happens, never leave me…
                    We will never get tired of each other. Whatever happens, we will share everything with each other. We will never let a third person come between us…
                    You give me your full support and I will give you mine…
                    Give me your hand in my hand and never let it go  my love....then you will see what I can do for you, how far I can go to have you… you will see.
                    You are scared that your father won’t agree to our marriage…
                    If your father doesn’t agree then I will talk to him myself. I will meet him. You will also have to convince him...to have each other we can do anything…
                    My love, never go to any other boy… Never betray me please please please please…</p>
